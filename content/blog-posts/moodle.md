When I was teaching the electrical trade at United Planning Organization in the District of Columbia, I used a hybrid method. Lectures were in person, but I had all activities that were not hands on, done through my Moodle site that I hosted at Bluehost.com.

I hosted that site for about two years, with a few hundred students using over that time. Even a few other instructors ended up trying it out. This was not funded by the school, but out of my own pocket, when I was no longer teaching there, I pulled the site down. It was a great experience setting up a server with remote hosting 2014-2016 time frame.
